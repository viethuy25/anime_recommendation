# anime_recommendation
This is a simple 3 layers anime recommendation: SVD, Neural Collab Filtering and Feed Forward Neural Network model.
MAE: 1.18
RMSE: 1.59


Based on the chart below, it seems that the 2 most popular genres have an average score of 7, while the highest score genre is actually not a common genre. This might hints to potential outliers (Gintama for instance) help to pull this genre up. In general, manga has the widest reach and genders do not play a significant role in the overall popularity and scoring system. With that being said, there are still mainstream themes that can be well-received by a gender while it is not the same for other ones.
